### Important
We are always looking for motivated and talented students.

### Postdoc
Comming soon ...

### Ph.D.
We typically admit **one** Ph.D. student per year. All motivated students are encouraged to apply. Strong mathematical foundation in Linear Algebra is essential, preferably with knowledge on Multiple View Geometry. Having some knowledge on optimization is also a plus. You must have had prior exposure to research/projects relevant to Computer Vision, and we also expect that you have experience with deep learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, thus having prior exposure to Deep Learning. Having a publication in relevant domains is also a great plus, but not necessarily required.

### Thesis Masters
Master positions are more focused on short-term projects as they typically last no longer than two years. We expect you to be proficient in Python, and could learn how to use deep learning tools in one term. The following projects are of potential interest (with no guarantee).
